toDo:

flexPick.py

1. https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher/blob/master/src/riotwatcher/_apis/league_of_legends/ChampionMasteryApiV4.py
    Use scores.by.summoner to find a player's total champion ChampionMasteryApiV4
    
2. Find way to find all champion mastery level 5+ (loop through champion mastery and use 'if' statement to find 5+ levels, perhaps)
    Count the number of champion masteries over level 5

3. Divide  total champion mastery by number of champion masteries over 5

4. Return 3 output: this number roughly represents how much a player can 'flex pick'
